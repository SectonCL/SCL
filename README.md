# SCL
SCL is an command-line interpreter that's built on pure Python.

## State
It is ready to use.

## What's not done yet
* Scripts for SCL (something like .bat)
* sectonfetch localization
* Language switching

## Windows support?
nope. I can't compile it for Windows and i don't know why, PyInstaller only supports Linux AFAIK.
