![SCL Logo](scllogo.webp "SCL Logo")
> [!IMPORTANT]
> SCL is now being deprecated in favor of SRSh
-----
SCL is an command-line interpreter that's built on pure Python.

## Modules to install
`termcolor` `webbrowser` `easygui_qt` `screeninfo`

## What was not done
* Scripts for SCL support (something like .bat)
* Language preference auto-save

## Windows/macOS binaries?
I don't have the ability to cross-compile right now...

By the way, this logo isn't random; This logo is kind of like a puzzle.
Here's the hint: letters SCL and colors RGB are on the logo (Letter S doesn't have a horizontal line that's on the middle)
