-----
SCL is an command-line interpreter that's built on pure Python.

## Modules to install (For source code)
`termcolor`, `webbrowser`

## What's not done yet
* Scripts for SCL support (something like .bat)
* Language preference auto-save
* Help command

## Windows/macOS support?
nope. I can't compile it for Windows or macOS and i don't know why, PyInstaller only supports Linux AFAIK.

by the way, just wanna say something. This logo isn't random; This logo is kind of like a puzzle.
Here's the hint: letters SCL and colors RGB are on the logo (Letter S doesn't have a horizontal line that's on the middle.
